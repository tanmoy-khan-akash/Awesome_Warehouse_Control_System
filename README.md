## 📖 Overview

A **Warehouse Control System (WCS)** acts as the real-time nervous system of automated facilities, positioned directly between the **WMS / ERP layer** and **physical industrial automation**. It orchestrates material-handling equipment (MHE) including conveyors, sorters, AS/RS cranes, shuttles, AMRs/AGVs, robotic picking arms, palletizers, and PLC controllers.

This curated list features enterprise **Commercial SaaS / Hosted Platforms** ranked by company valuation & revenue, alongside a sorted catalog of **Open-Source GitHub Projects** and automation building blocks with real-time star metrics.

## ⚖️ Disclaimer

* This is a **community-curated** list — not exhaustive and not a commercial endorsement.
* Commercial warehouse-control platforms are often sold and deployed alongside complete engineering and material handling projects.
* Open-source software must be paired with industrial-grade safety systems, certified emergency-stop circuits (PL-d/SIL-2+), network segmentation, and thorough fail-safe validation before driving physical warehouse machinery.
* Always review project licenses, security patches, and protocol compatibility before deploying into production environments.
